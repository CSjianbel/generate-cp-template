## Clone

Ideally the compiled executable must be added onto your PATH.<br />
Therefore you will have access to the executable globally in your system.<br />

### Linux Setup

- Create a **bin/** directory in your root directory (~)
- Create another directory within the bin directory
- Open **gcpt.cpp** and set the **tempFile** variable to your desired path to the **template.cpp** file and **Makefile**
- Copy the compiled executable and the templates folder inside the directory you created
- Add the directory to your PATH

## Usage

```bash
./gcpt [outfile_path.cpp]
```
